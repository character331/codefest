# Inspiration

Mike woke up on a Saturday morning and searched for events happening near University City this weekend, so that he could hang out with his friend and have some fun. With Google Maps open on his phone, Mike browsed through the news on Visit Philly and Eventbrite. He wanted to plan his routes across the places holding interesting events. In order to do so, he had to mark each event (place) one by one on his map. "Why don't they just put all the news on one map?" thought poor Mike, feeling exhausted.

The inspiration behind MapIntel was to create a personalized news application that would make it easy for users to stay informed about news events that are relevant to their interests and location. With a focus on community and culture, we aimed to create an application that would help users stay connected to the events and issues that matter most to them.

What it does
------------

MapIntel uses AI technology to process user input and identify relevant news events, which are then displayed on a map for easy viewing. Users can customize their news alerts based on their interests and location, and receive personalized notifications when new events occur. With a focus on community and culture, MapIntel helps users stay informed about events that are happening in their local area and around the country.

How we built it
---------------

MapIntel was built using a variety of technologies, including news API, openAI, Flask, Google Maps API, Selenium, and web scrapers. We used AI algorithms to process user input and identify relevant news events, and incorporated a user-friendly map display to make it easy for users to see where events are occurring.

Challenges we ran into
----------------------

One of the biggest challenges we faced was integrating multiple technologies into a cohesive application. We also had to overcome technical issues related to web scraping and data processing.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
-----------------------------------

We are proud to have created a personalized news application that is both user-friendly and accessible. By incorporating AI technology and a map display, we believe that we have created a unique and valuable tool for users. We are also proud to have focused on community and culture as key elements of the application.

What we learned
---------------

Throughout the development of MapIntel, we learned a great deal about AI technology, data processing, and web scraping. We also gained valuable experience in integrating multiple technologies into a single application.

What's next for MapIntel
------------------------

In the future, we plan to continue to improve MapIntel by incorporating more advanced AI algorithms, expanding our data sources, and enhancing our map display features. We also hope to make the application available to a wider audience, and to continue to refine and improve its user experience. Additionally, we plan to continue to focus on community and culture, and to provide users with news and information that is relevant to their local area and their interests.
